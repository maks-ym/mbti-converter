# mbti-converter

MBTI personality type to cognitive functions converter (decoder)

### Motivation

1) I was currious about cognitive functions for different personality types but was too lazy to do a conversion by hand each time and found only instructions how to do that in the Internet.
2) Didn't want to use simple dictionary for that but to implement the actual steps for manual conversion.
